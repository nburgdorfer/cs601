1. a. For a given undirected graph G = {V,E} with degree k, we show a polynomial time algorithm to color the graph with k+1 colors.
	-Start with any node in the graph. We choose here to start with the node with the highest degree.
	-Add this node to a coloring queue (a queue of nodes to be colored)
	-while the queue is not empty,
		-grab the node at the front of the queue
		-grab all connected neighbors of the node
		-record all neighbor colors
		-color the current node any color from our k+1 color set that is not a member of the neighbor colors set (which is at most k).
		-any of the neighbors that do not have a color, add to the queue

A.	Since x_i = {0,1}, we replace all x_i = 1 and -x_i = 0, since 1%2=1 and 0%2=0. The statement x_i v x_j becomes (x_i + x_j)%2.
