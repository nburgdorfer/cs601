    An example of a language L such that neither L nor the compliment of L (which we denote as -L) is TM-recognizable would be the language L that accepts all string of even length: L = { w : |w| is even}.

    To prove that L is not TM-recognizable, we will use the diagonalization arguement. We first assume that L is TM-recognizable. If it is TM-recognizable, then there must exist a TM, M, that recognizes it. On input w, M either accepts input w if w is of even length, rejects input w if w is not of even length, or loops on forever if input w is not of even length. If L is TM-recognizable, then there must exist an Enumerator for the language. We label this Enumerator E. E prints out every and all accepting (even length) strings for the language L.
